# Project 1 - SAT Analysis

## Problem Statement

Many students are not taking the SAT, which is an important test for getting into college. This is a problem because it makes it harder for them to apply to schools and limits their chances for a good education. We need to find ways to help more students take the SAT. This could include looking at reasons why some students donâ€™t take the test.

## Key Findings

1. The overall SAT participation rate is going up; however, there are still 23 states that do not meet the average participation rate.
2. In the five states with the lowest participation rates, the SAT participation rate is only 2-3%, yet these states have a high ACT participation rate.

## Dataset

There are 6 original datasets used in this project:

- [`act_2017.csv`](./data/act_2017.csv): 2017 ACT Scores by State ([source](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows))
- [`act_2018.csv`](./data/act_2018.csv): 2018 ACT Scores by State ([source](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows))
- [`act_2019.csv`](./data/act_2019.csv): 2019 ACT Scores by State ([source](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows))
- [`sat_2017.csv`](./data/sat_2017.csv): 2017 SAT Scores by State ([source](https://blog.collegevine.com/here-are-the-average-sat-scores-by-state/))
- [`sat_2018.csv`](./data/sat_2018.csv): 2018 SAT Scores by State ([source](https://blog.collegevine.com/here-are-the-average-sat-scores-by-state/))
- [`sat_2019.csv`](./data/sat_2019.csv): 2019 SAT Scores by State ([source](https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-sat-scores-by-state-most-recent))

## Conclusion

Three states mentioned in the presentation have maintained a 100% participation rate over the last three years. These states can serve as examples of best practices to improve SAT participation rates in other states.
